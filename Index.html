            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p><strong>University of Pittsburgh</strong> (Expected August 2025)</p>
            <p>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</p>
            <p>Track: Cybersecurity | Minor: Computer Science | GPA: 3.52</p>

            <h2>Project Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3> Digital Humanities XML Project – Computational Methods in the Humanities</h3>
                <li>Developed and structured XML code for marking up Romeo and Juliet by analyzing the structure of the documents and creating custom tags to represent metadata and content accurately. Used Oxygen XML Editor to ensure the code was well-formed and valid, allowing for seamless integration into digital archives. Using Oxygen XML Editor, I contributed by designing a dynamic navigation bar with XSLT, enabling users to navigate acts and scenes seamlessly through clickable links. Additionally, I analyzed the document's structure to implement custom tags, enhancing accessibility, usability, and integration into digital archives</li>
                <h3>Security Risk Assessment – Computer Security</h3>
                <li>Assisted in a comprehensive security risk assessment by conducting a detailed analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities throughout the student building. I worked closely with my team to evaluate security systems, interview stakeholders, and review past incidents, identifying 15 critical security risks. Collaborated in developing prevention strategies which included improving physical security measures, updating software, and enhancing staff training to mitigate these risks. </li>
                <h3>Java Student Grade Tracker Application - Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                <li>Designed and implemented a command-line interface (CLI) that allows instructors to input and track student grades. I applied object-oriented programming principles to create a modular, scalable application with functions for grade calculations, data validation, and error handling. This project optimized grade management for instructors by simplifying input methods and ensuring accuracy in grade calculations.</li>
